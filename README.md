# MergeSort

**index.html** visualises how *Merge Sort* works in general

**algorithm.js** is a possible Javascript implementation

## Prerequisite
If not already done, the collection has to be converted into a list.  
Therefore, every value is wrapped by an object
that contains, besides the value, a pointer to the object
containing the next value. 

## Basic idea
Merging two well-sorted lists into one has very low costs.  
To do so, the list with the start element
expected to be more left will be the starting point;
the respective next element will be either the next element
in the actual list or the next unregarded element
in the other list.
